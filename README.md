# Items Synchronizer

WIP - This isn't functional yet.

## Description
Synchronize items from two different sources.

This library aims to offer an abstract and versatile way to create, update
and/or delete items to keep two "sources" in sync.

These "items" may range from Calendar entries, TODO task lists, or whatever else
you want as long as the user registers the appropriate functions/methods to
convert from one said item to another.

## Installation

Add it as a dependency to either your `requirements.txt` or to `pyproject.toml`

TODO - Add example

## Example Usage
## Extra Configuration
